1st day of learning how to program in python! 

Some things that I have known and reinforced: 
print ("") 
variables 
concantenate (+) 

And somethings that I don't remember learning but have a background of: 
input("")
len()

completely new to me: 
\n --> basically creates a new line, at least that's how I demonstrated in this code.
